# Ryl's Steam Bot
A simple steam bot I'm working on.

## Required
```bash
$ Node.js
```
## Optional
```bash
$ Cleverbot features which require a username & key ( https://cleverbot.io/ )
```

## How to install:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RoyalMafia/Ryl-s-Steam-Bot.git
$ cd Ryl-s-Steam-Bot
$ npm install
$ node bot.js {Steam Username} {Steam Password}
```
When you run the script you may be asked for a Steam Guard Authentication code. 

## Current Chat Commands:
```bash
$ !cmds - Displays all available commands & a description
$ !chatroom - Creates a chat room & invites / Invites (If a chat room already exists) to exist chat room
$ !invchat - Invites you to a chat room if one exists
```

## Current Features:
```bash
$ Can create chat rooms
$ Can invite users who ask to be invited to the existing chat room
$ Has an autoresponse feature if the user doesn't specify an existing command using cleverbot.io
$ Auto accept friend requests
$ Kick players from chat room using chat commands
```

## To do:
```bash
$ Ban players from chat
$ Group invites
$ Trading (Probably will be used for middleman trades, not sure)
```
