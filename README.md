# ryl's spam bot
This is a spam bot for steam.

## Required
```bash
$ Node.js
```

## How to install:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RoyalMafia/ryls-spam-bot.git
$ cd ryls-spam-bot
$ npm install
```
OR
```bash
$ download zip and extract

$ enter 'npm install'
```

### How to run the bot
```bash
$ open cmd and set cur dir to the bots dir
$ enter 'node bot.js {Steam Username} {Steam Password}'
```

When you run the script you maybe asked for a Steam Guard Authentication code. 

### Usage
Once you've logged in you'll be asked for a target, for this you only need to enter a part of their name ( example: "roya" will find "royalmafia" etc ).
Once it has found the user it'll ask you how many times you want the message to be sent, I limited it to a max of 999 messages.
Finally you'll be asked for the message which will be spammed.
